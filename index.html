                    Hello my name is Jonah Olsen. I am currently enrolled in BYUI as a cyber security major. I have two brothers and a cat back home in Havre De Grace Maryland. I absolutely love to learn about all sorts of random things. Currently I am learning a crafted language called Toki Pona!
                    The attribute that I value most is time management. For me there is no more valuable resource than time and I try to be careful who I give mine to. I believe that since we are only given a limited amount of time on this earth that makes it our duty to spend that time wisely. 
                </p>

                    My very first job was working the kitchen at Chick-Fil-A during COVID. It was difficult working in a kitchen with all those restrictions but it taught me to be flexible which helped a lot during the next part of my life. After Chick-Fil-A I went on my mission where I worked at the Global Service Department (GSD). At the GSD I responded to emails about technical problems that members were having with Member Tools. After a couple months I was promoted to Group Leader where I oversaw the gospel meetings that we had every day. A couple months after that I was promoted to the Lead Group Leader where I conducted weekly devotionals and managed and trained other group leaders and gospel teachers for the rest of my mission. I had so much fun and learned so much at the GSD and I can’t wait to see what happens next!
