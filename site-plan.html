      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello my name is Jonah Olsen. I am making a website to display and show off my various passion projects. The website would contain links to references I used to learn as well as pictures, articles, and social media posts showing off the skills in question. This would be an interactive website with small games I programmed as well as videos of art that I have done. I would mainly use this as a one size fits all reference for future job applications. But it could be used by all sorts of people who are interested in some of the many things that I have learned over the years.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <p>About me:
        Hello my name is Jonah Olsen. I am currently enrolled in BYUI as a cyber security major. I have two brothers and a cat back home in Havre De Grace Maryland. I absolutely love to learn about all sorts of random things. Currently I am learning a crafted language called Toki Pona!
        The attribute that I value most is time management. For me there is no more valuable resource than time and I try to be careful who I give mine to. I believe that since we are only given a limited amount of time on this earth that makes it our duty to spend that time wisely.
        </p>

        <p>My experience:
My very first job was working the kitchen at Chick-Fil-A during COVID. It was difficult working in a kitchen with all those restrictions but it taught me to be flexible which helped a lot during the next part of my life. After Chick-Fil-A I went on my mission where I worked at the Global Service Department (GSD). At the GSD I responded to emails about technical problems that members were having with Member Tools. After a couple months I was promoted to Group Leader where I oversaw the gospel meetings that we had every day. A couple months after that I was promoted to the Lead Group Leader where I conducted weekly devotionals and managed and trained other group leaders and gospel teachers for the rest of my mission. I had so much fun and learned so much at the GSD and I can’t wait to see what happens next!

      <h3>Tech</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Code examples:

          [wordle game code snippet]: Here is a clone of the New York Times’ Wordle that works exclusively in the terminal.
          
          [adventure game example]: This is a text based adventure game I built for a programming class with an integrated rock, paper, scissors game!
          
          [Turing test example]: This is my best attempt at passing the turing test. It might just be up there with the latest versions of AI.
          
          [AI generated Website]: I have been messing around with AI a lot lately. Here is one of my nicest looking websites that I’ve been able to generate with just Chat GPT-4o.
          </p>

          <p>Classes/courses: 
            Currently I am enrolled in a Cloud Tech Class, 2 Python classes (“Intro to Programming” and “Programming with Functions”), and a Web Fundamentals class. I have also completed a couple online programming courses that range from C++ to JavaScript.

      <h3>Art</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Boss battle art competition. 
          This was a challenge I did that involved more photscanning than I have ever done before. Most of everything in the picture is photo scanned with a few exceptions (fireball, grass, clouds).
          </p>
        <p> Interior design:
          I have really enjoyed making little bedrooms and bathrooms. It has been a very relaxing way for me to create art. I have also been having a lot of fun researching the Chinese art of Feng Shui to improve my interior design.
          </p>
        <p>Cabin in the Woods:
          This was one of the first of what would later become a series of “little people renders”. I really enjoyed being able to focus on the lighting with these renders.
          </p>
        <p>The All-Jonah:
          This was a piece that I “commissioned for myself” because I wanted to have something custom for my background. It had all of my proudest projects attached to it when I made it. But many years have past since I made this and I have been considering remaking a newer version.
